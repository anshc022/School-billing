# School Billing System (The "Make Money" App) 💰

Welcome to the School Billing System! This is the magical box where you put student names in, and money comes out (well, records of money). It's designed for humans, not robots, so you don't need a PhD in Computer Science to use it.

## 🌟 What does it do? (The Cool Stuff)

*   **Student Tracker 🕵️**: Keep tabs on all the little rascals. Who are they? Where do they live? Do they owe you money? Now you know.
*   **Fee Collector 💸**: The most important part. Record who paid, who didn't, and who needs a friendly reminder.
*   **Receipt Printer 🖨️**: Make professional-looking slips so parents know you're serious business.
*   **Dashboard 📊**: A fancy screen with charts that makes you look like a Wall Street genius.
*   **Dark Mode 🌙**: Because billing at 2 AM requires saving your retinas.

## 🚀 How to Use (The "I don't code" guide)

1.  **Download it**: Grab the file that ends in `.exe` (if you're on Windows).
2.  **Run it**: Double-click it like you mean it.
3.  **Log in**: Use `admin` as the username and `admin123` as the password. (Shh, it's a secret. Change it later in Settings!).
4.  **Profit**: Start adding students and collecting fees!

## 🆘 Help! It's Broken!

If the screen goes white or the computer starts making funny noises:
1.  Did you try turning it off and on again?
2.  Is your computer plugged in?
3.  If all else fails, just close your eyes and hope it fixes itself. (Or contact the developer).
